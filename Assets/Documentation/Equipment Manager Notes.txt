1. InAttackState decides whether equipped.
2. What weapon decides which weapon to equip.
3. And weapon-type affects the latter animations. 
	
	**Something like this held within animationPlayer attackstack logic
		If (sword) then animate this
		else if (gun) animate this

STEPS: 

Plan - have two equipment pieces. A Gun on hip and a Gun in hand. Make opaque that which is true.
1. Place second weapon
2. Figure out the opague logic and toggle
3. Use state to toggle

** CHARACTER STOPS IDLING IN GUN IDLE

PROGRESS:

1. Made a function in Equipment Manager
2. Figured out a real jenky way to get the rotation after attack state
3. Now adding the input via TrackUserInput. 
	A - How am I suppose to Equip the weapon without calling it repeatedly AND
	    should I be placing this in the trackInput area? Seems I am now adding
	    extra complexity where it should only track input. (SOLVED)
4. Solved the update() instantiation of the bullet by using Input.GetKeyDown(); 
5. Errors to solve: 
	(A) Area effects on bullets effect character. Either change collide setting on bullet or parent/script model. 
	    One is easier and the other is more scalable and bug free.
